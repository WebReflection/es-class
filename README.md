es-class
========

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/WebReflection/es-class.png)](http://travis-ci.org/WebReflection/es-class)


### A future proof, backward compatible, JavaScript class utility.

  * **ES6** and **ES7** friendly, through semantic `extends` and `constructor` plus other previously discussed features
  * **ES5** natively compatible granting that what you see is what you wrote, without needing intermediate transpilers
  * **ES3** backward compatible, thanks to common minification that will create a safe production code, wrapping keywords that once upon a time were reserved

Feel free to [test all features](http://webreflection.github.io/es-class/test/) related to this project, and please come back if your browser is not green.
